Pre-requirements for the plex manager bot:
-have 1 or more plex servers running to manage.
-if you intend to have activity based removal, then have 1 tautulli instance per server running and pointed at the plex server(s)

This is recorded from the perspective of creating a new discord server.
Create your discord server and then create the Application and Bot.

copy the fresh.py and requirements.txt file to your desired location.

run pip install -r requirements.txt from that location in command prompt/shell.

in the fresh.py file:
-update the GUILD_ID, database path (between the quotes), and CLIENT_TOKEN

Instead of figuring out what permissions are needed in discord:
-enable all intents.
-check the bot scope
-check administrator permissions.

run python fresh.py (you can automate this however you like.)

anywhere the bot can see a message it should reply with the fact that its not configured.
When you dm it !configure, it will respond with the paramaters it needs you to send.

doublecheck every value before you hit enter.
